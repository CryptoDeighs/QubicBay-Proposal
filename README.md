# QubicBay-Proposal

**NFT MARKETPLACE PROPOSAL**

**Project Overview**

We have developed the first Smart Contract that will allow NFT technology to be brought to Qubic tickchain. New blood, new users will be attracted by this possibility, creating greater interest and attention for the entire ecosystem.

**Marketplace functionality**

Functions Specifications

The Smart contract contains all the necessary functions expected from a typical NFT Marketplace, which are: 

mint

buy

sell

transfer

exchange

auction

floor price

make an offer

accept offer

getting NFT info

Thanks to this Smart Contract we will be able to launch an NFT Marketplace on Qubic tickchain, where users will be able to create/drop/mint NFTs/collections, buy/sell and trade NFTs.

**Fee Structure**

For each resale of NFTs on the secondary market, the Marketplace will retain a percentage of the total resale equal to 2.5%, which will be distributed as follows: 

2% will be retained by the Marketplace to cover management costs and future developments
0.5% will be sent to shareholders (check 'shareholder revenues' paragraph for more details)

**Shareholder revenues**

Shareholders will receive as revenue 0.5% of all sales made on the secondary market, only and exclusively where the sale is made with $Qubic as the payment method. 
If sales on the secondary market are paid with $CFB token, shareholders will not receive any percentage as revenues.

**Coins/Tokens accepted on the Marketplace**

Both $CFB and $Qubic will be accepted on the Marketplace, and both can be used by users to buy/sell NFTs on the secondary market.

However, there are some exclusive functions reserved for each: 

Only $Qubic will be accepted for minting NFTs (primary market)

On the other hand, $CFB will have a reserved exclusive function: the purchase of packages.

**What are packages?**

Packages (slots) explained
Whenever creators wants to launch a new collection of NFTs on our Marketplace, they will necessarily have to purchase a package of mintable NFTs (slots), the cost of which will vary based on the number of NFTs that will be part of the collection, i.e. for a collection of 1000 NFTs users will have to purchase a package worth 200 USDT of $CFB and so on up to a maximum of a package of 10,000 pieces of NFTs worth 2000 USDT in $CFB. 
 

**Creator earnings**

When creating a new collection, creators will be able to decide whether to withhold a percentage from future resales of the NFTs created, up to a maximum of 10%. This percentage, chosen by them, is necessary to support the work of creators and encourage them to use our platform.

**Technical Details**

Scope of service and Platform Features

**Platform Design:**

Web3 Interface for seamless NFT trading and management
Smart Contract integration for secure NFT transactions
Responsive Frontend & Backend Development for optimal user experience

**Core Functionalities:**

NFT Minting: Create and launch new NFT collections
NFT Trading: Buy, sell and transfer NFTs
Collection Management: Create and manage NFT collections
Marketplace Features: Listings, offers, auctions

**Smart Contract Integration:**

Wallet Integration via Qubic connect (metamask, walletconnect and ledger  (as soon it is available)
Secure transaction handling
 
**SC Storage management**

Datasets (holder address, URI for NFT) are stored in the smart contract. The metadata, however, is stored on dedicated services (IPFS). Based on current estimates, users are able to create exactly up to 4194304 NFTs on 1GB storage, i.e. if one collection includes 3~4k NFTs, our platform can support up to 1000 collections. Furthermore, in the future, the storage capacity of Smart Contracts will be increased to 8-16 GB.

**Future improvements**

Integration with a mobile wallet: as the platform grows we will also integrate the Marketplace with the mobile wallet, this way we will allow users to mint/buy/sell NFTs from a mobile phone or tablet.

We will also continue to invest in and improve the Marketplace. It remains clear, in fact, that the one currently developed is an MVP version of the Marketplace, since, as is known, the costs to develop a full Marketplace is very expensive.

**Tech Stack**

Frontend 

React

Typescript

Vite

Qubic connect (metamask snap, walletconnect and ledger)

**Backend**

Node.js

Typescript

REST API

Database

PostgreSQL

Smart Contract

Infrastructure

AWS or Heroku

**Team**

Pepito: Project leader and $CFB ideator 

Poly: Smart Contract developer 

Serendipity: Frontend and Backend developer 

**Conclusion**

We believe that an NFT Marketplace is necessary to bridge the gap between Qubic, understood as an ecosystem, and the most famous and established blockchains. NFTs have the ability to attract that segment of more casual users, i.e. that user necessary to become mainstream. Furthermore, NFTs would also and above all pave the way for artists who would be pushed to create on an emerging ecosystem, creating new life and new possibilities for future developments. This is the opportunity to show to the crypto space the potential of our ecosystem!
